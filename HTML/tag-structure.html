<!-- tags follow this structure: -->

<tag-name>content</tag-name>

<!-- 
    'tag-name' is the name of the tag. different tags have different properties and use cases. 

    'content' is the content of the tag, it can be plain text or even another tag 

    '<tag-name>' is the 'opening' tag, '</tag-name>' is the 'closing' tag 

    all tags follow this format of where both opening and closing tags are surrounded by <>, 
    and the closing tag also includes the forward slash before the tagname 
-->

<!-- heres a real example of a 'div' tag -->
<div>content</div>

<!-- 
    some tags, such as the img or link tag , are 'self-closing' 
    meaning they only have an opening tag and no content:
-->

<img src="image.jpg" alt="image">
<link rel="relationship" href="resource">
