    <h1>Debounce vs Throttle</h1>
    <input type="text">

    <div>
        <h3>default:</h3>
        <span id="default"></span>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>debounce:</h3>
        <span id="debounce"></span> 
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>throttle:</h3>
        <span id="throttle"></span>

<!-- bubbling and capturing refer to the order of event handlers firing when the same event triggers callbacks on both parent and child elements. 
the most basic example would be a click event bound to both a parent and child element
when the child is clicked, the parent is also clicked, so which click event fires first?
by default the child fires first, but the event listener can take an optional third argument after the event name and callbacks
this is the useCapture argument, which is a boolean. When useCapture is false, which it is by default, bubbling is used, 
meaning the child fires before the parent. Then it is true, capturing is used, meaning the parent fires before the child. 
the examples below will illustrate this by logging the order of click events on child, parent, and grandparent elements. -->


    <h1>Bubbling vs Capturing</h1>
    <p>look at the console to see which order the click events fire when clicking child</p>
    <h2>Bubbling:</h2>
    <div id="bub-grandparent">
        <p>grandparent</p>
        <div id="bub-parent">
            <p>parent</p>
            <div id="bub-child">
                <p>child</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Capturing:</h2>
    <div id="cap-grandparent">
        <p>grandparent</p>
        <div id="cap-parent">
            <p>parent</p>
            <div id="cap-child">
                <p>child</p>
            </div>
